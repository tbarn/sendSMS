sendSMS
=======

Uses the Flask framework and Twilio API to send you a text via a web form - lots of room for improvement

Also tracks when a message is sent with Keen IO API

Example local_settings.py file used for configuration with some added configuration for Heroku (not complete): https://gist.github.com/tbarn/d64a2f5991c7f54bb7e5
